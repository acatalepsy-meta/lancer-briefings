# Mission // 002B
## Operation Firebreak

With the breakthrough along the coast, **WARN ALKIV** will soon be effectively encircled. To prevent this, Union forces will launch a counterattack to clear an evacuation route from the city. 

# Goals
- Evacuate allied forces from Warn Alkiv pocket. 
- Raid enemy combat operations center.

# Stakes
- Defeat here will be a deep loss of combat power for the coaltion overall, and huge blow to morale. 
- If the Schismists maintain their momentum, they likely be able to push into Bakira proper. 
- This is the first opportunity Horizon has had to unravel the connection between **CLARION** and Schismist high command.
