# Roadown - Safehouse // 5.21.5018u

Following the defeat of the **CLARION** group, squad leader **WHISPER** departs with **UMMA MATIX** to pursue the trail west towards schismist territory. While they track down the still-mysterious group, the remaining **DRAGONS OF THE SPINE** retask themselves to cleaning up the mess left by **CLARION** in Basit and securing the political future of the city-state. 

Cleaning up first means securing the remaining communications node not under the control of **BURNING EYES**, driving off the disorganized Schismist groups, to secure the resources and breathing space for the diminished hacking group. Their efforts pay off in the form of additional anti-EW gear, supplies, and combat subalterns. 

# Basit - Burning Eyes FOB // 5.22.5018u

Despite reservations, the **DRAGONS OF THE SPINE** agree to the terms set by **SOLUDE IMPENDING** and begin preparations for assault on the remaining holdouts among the Basit Securitat.
