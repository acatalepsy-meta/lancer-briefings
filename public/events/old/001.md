# Roadown - Safehouse // 5.21.5018u

Following the defeat of the **CLARION** group, squad leader **WHISPER** departs with **UMMA MATIX** to pursue the trail west towards schismist territory. While they track down the still-mysterious group, the remaining **DRAGONS OF THE SPINE** retask themselves to cleaning up the mess left by **CLARION** in Basit and securing the political future of the city-state. 

Cleaning up first means securing the remaining communications node not under the control of **BURNING EYES**, driving off the disorganized Schismist groups, to secure the resources and breathing space for the diminished hacking group. Their efforts pay off in the form of additional anti-EW gear, supplies, and combat subalterns.

After successfully securing the HQ of the Basit Securitat, **SOLUDE IMPENDING** forms a coalition government with the **PARTY OF STANDING**; their contacts in the Basit Military rally to defend the new coalition from attacks by the **HOUSE HASSAT**, the hired soldiers of the **SMOLAK DYNASTY**. The mercenary forces quickly begin to withdraw, but an elite strike force attempts to sieze one of the new coalition's key military allies, **GENERAL ELSKY**. The **DRAGONS OF THE SPINE** mobilize to fend off their assault and secure the general.
