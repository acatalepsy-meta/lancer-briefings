## Biographical Data

Genos “Braver” Knight is a young Lancer who suddenly appeared as a featured contender in a syndicated mech gladiatorial competition. Though rumors of his Albatross origin remained unconfirmed, it didn’t stop the league from branding their newest asset as a chivalrous persona, determined to conquer his opponents through honor and virtue. However, the young Lancer chafed against his newly assigned celebrity character and began to rebel. To the league’s annoyance he introduced escalating savagery to both his mech’s aspect and his combat style, and made frequent appearances with the Flash Circuit racer, Eris Rao.

Genos’s career climaxed and ended abruptly when the league commission disenfranchised him immediately following a cameo in the Von holovid production “Savage Void,” in which he portrayed the star’s vicious adversary. Despite fan outcry, Genos silently accepted the league’s decision and vanished from the public lens. Through circumstances unknown, he next appeared in a small mercenary unit, along with Rao and Von, to join those others who saw an opportunity in the brewing conflict at Mnemosyne.


## Commentary
 
• His unusually young age, impressive Lancer abilities, and perhaps coincidental resemblance to a prominent Albatross bloodline continue to fuel rumors of his mysterious origin
• He is possessed of a calm and laconic demeanor in a stark contrast to a brutally violent piloting style
• Genos remains disinterested in the greater morality and stakes of conflict and defers to the decisions of his squad mates
• Despite not impressing his own motives upon the squad, he often commits downtime to improving team operations and expanding resources
