## Biographical Data

Mickey was raised on Mnemosyne in her fatherâ€™s scrapyard. Putting together scrap metal to make makeshift mechs for fighting rings was their specialty, and Mickey had a knack for finding rare pieces. In her searches amongst the urban landscape of Bakira, she found a lone chassis and SSC licenses. It was left in a derelict warehouse, but looked new, alone. Ignoring her better instincts she brought it home. At first, the SSC Dustwing was a hit amongst the scrapper fighting rings, with Mickey at its helm, but then disaster struck in the midst of a match, leaving many dead. A retaliation hit was moved against Mickey, and her father among many others winded up paying the price. Amidst the chaos of the remnants of the ring, she managed to flee to Union, so she may have protection, and more, so she could protect those vulnerable like her father.
