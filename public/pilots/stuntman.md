## Biographical Data

A metropolitan actor hailing from the world of Cradle, Gille was famous for his insistance on A) only using practical effects for his holovids, and B) doing all of his own stunts. His pretty-boy demeanor, obssession with fashion, and generally panzy attitude belie a man who has likely broken every bone in his body at least once throughout his career in cinima. Never one to shy away from danger (and possessing a reckless disregard for his own safety), Gille has always harbored a dream: to be a hero instead of acting as one. 

After playing the lead role in "On the Wings of Angles", a semi-historical holo-vid based on the origins of the Albatross, Gille shocked the media landscape by announcing his retirement. Inspired by the organization he pretended to be a part of, Gille has decided to become the mask; that is, to join the Albatross and finally become a hero in both name and deed. If he can avoid getting himself killed, of course.
